## Usage

CodeJet solves the problem of disjointed collaboration in software development by providing a centralized platform where individuals and teams can work together on coding projects in real-time. Traditional methods of collaboration often involve sharing files back and forth, leading to version control issues, duplicated efforts, and miscommunication. With CodeJet, these challenges are eliminated.

Firstly, CodeJet enables real-time code editing, allowing team members to see each other's changes instantly. This eliminates the need for multiple versions of files and ensures that everyone is working on the most up-to-date codebase.

Secondly, CodeJet includes integrated communication tools, such as chat features, allowing team members to discuss ideas, ask questions, and provide feedback within the same platform where they're coding. This streamlines communication and keeps discussions relevant to the task at hand.

Overall, CodeJet promotes collaboration efficiency by providing a single platform for coding and communication, ultimately accelerating project completion times and improving overall team productivity.

## Contributing


If you’re asking about how to contribute to a project on GitHub, here’s a general process that is commonly followed:

1.  Fork the Repository: The first step is to create a copy of the project on your own GitHub account. This can be done by clicking the ‘Fork’ button on the repository’s page.
    Clone the Repository: Once you have forked the repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname.git
    ```

2.  Replace yourusername with your GitHub username and repositoryname with the name of the repository you want to clone.

3.  Create a New Branch: It’s a good practice to create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix you’re working on. You can do this using the following command:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b branch-name
    ```
4.  Replace branch-name with a name that describes the feature or fix you’re working on.

5.  Make Your Changes: Now, you can make your changes in the code.
    
    Commit Your Changes: Once you’re done, you can commit your changes using the following commands:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Commit message"
    ```
6.  Replace Commit message with a brief description of the changes you made.

7.  Push Your Changes: You can then push your changes to your forked repository using the following command:
    ```bash
    git push origin branch-name
    ```
    Replace branch-name with the name of the branch you created earlier.

    Create a Pull Request: Finally, you can go to your forked repository on GitHub and click the ‘New pull request’ button. Fill in the necessary details and submit the pull request. The project maintainers will then review your changes and decide whether to merge them into the main project.
